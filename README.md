In addition to lists of county Commissioners and their local Deputies, these surveys represent a crude census of local populations, including numbers of people engaged as mariners and fishermen (including boys). For many localities there are lists of vessels, sometimes indicating the name, type, tonnage, owner(s), master, and numbers of crew. Additionally, there is sometimes information about the local Customs management, including details of the types of goods traded and to what destinations.
